# NutriFood
 NutriFood is a web application that gives nutritional information from just an image of food. This includes calories, total fat, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, and more.

The FoodX-251 dataset(https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019) is used in this project to train a food recognition model.
