# NutriFood
 NutriFood is a web application that gives nutritional information from just an image of food. This includes calories, total fat, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, and more. It is designed to help people diet by informing them of whatâ€™s in their food before they eat, just like a Nutrition Facts label.

The FoodX-251 dataset(https://github.com/karansikka1/iFood_2019) is used in this project to train a food recognition model.
